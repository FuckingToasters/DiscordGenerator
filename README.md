## Artificial Intelligence

The AI of this bot is not mine and i dont take any credits for it.

It was created by QIN2DIM and can be found [here](https://github.com/QIN2DIM/hcaptcha-challenger).
If you want to update the AI because im late, you will have to grab the files from given repository.

`You maight want to regulary update objects.yaml by copy and pasting https://github.com/QIN2DIM/hcaptcha-challenger/blob/main/src/objects.yaml`

However, i edited out some code/files, to make DISLOCK lightweighter and to use less imports.

Also, i coded a MouseMovement Generator, to get more realistic MotionData. It uses Interpolation between CaptchaImage-Coordinates to do so.
